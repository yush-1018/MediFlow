## Project Overview
**MediFlow** is an enterprise-grade medical logistics platform engineered to solve the "Last Mile" medical supply crisis. By combining **Generative AI** for demand forecasting with **Heuristic Optimization** for redistribution, MediFlow transforms a fragmented, reactive supply chain into a proactive, life-saving ecosystem, specifically targeting cold-chain pharmaceutical integrity.

## The Problem | The Solution
**The Crisis:** Rural clinics often face 30% higher stockout rates for essential antibiotics, while urban hospitals simultaneously dispose of expired stock due to over-purchasing. This inequality is compounded by the lack of intelligent monitoring for cold-chain medicines (vaccines, insulin).

**The MediFlow Solution:** We don't just track inventory; we **predict** shortages before they happen and **automate** the movement of medicine from surplus hospitals to deficit clinics using road-accurate route optimization, ensuring that every life-saving resource is allocated where it’s needed most.

## Core Feature Set

### Hospital / Facility Module

| Feature | Detailed Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Logging Engine** | Atomically track daily usage while the system computes burn rates in real-time, ensuring zero data loss even in low-connectivity areas. |
| **AI Forecasting (30-Day)** | Powered by **Gemini-1.5-Flash**, predicting seasonal spikes based on historical usage trends (e.g., ORS demand for summer) with a transparency-first "AI Reasoning" component. |
| **Automated Request Drafting** | Intelligent auto-population of restock indents and redistribution offers based on AI predictions, reducing administrative overhead for clinic managers. |
| **AI Chat Assistant** | A 24/7 logistics expert that facility managers can query for stock status, expiry alerts, or burn-rate insights using natural language. |

### Central Administration Module

| Feature | Detailed Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Global Command Center** | Real-time regional oversight with deep-dive analytics into every facility's stock health, parity, and regional logistics KPIs. |
| **Approval Pipeline** | A secure hub for regional admins to review, edit, and prioritize redistribution plans proposed by the optimization engine. |
| **Interactive Logistics Map** | High-visibility markers distinguishing surplus sites from deficit clinics with integrated OSRM/ORS paths that calculate real-world travel time and distance. |
| **Global Optimization** | A "Global Redistribution Plan" that matches thousands of shortage items to local surpluses in seconds using our proprietary matching logic. |

---

## Technical Architecture

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. AI Engine (Gemini 1.5 Flash)** | We leverage Gemini's large context window to process months of anonymized usage logs. The model acts as a **Predictive Reasoning Layer**, identifying non-obvious patterns like demographic-based medicine consumption surges. |
| **2. Optimization Heuristic (OTS)** | Our proprietary **Optimal Transfer Score** ensures that redistribution is both efficient and equitable: <br><br> $$OTS = (w_{dist} \cdot Proximity) + (w_{prior} \cdot RuralPriority) + (w_{qty} \cdot QtyMatch)$$ <br><br> • **Proximity**: Minimizes logistics cost and time. <br> • **Rural Priority**: A weight multiplier ensuring that remote facilities are never "starved" by the algorithm. |
| **3. Geospatial Routing System** | Integrated with **flutter_map** and **OSRM/OpenRouteService**, our routing engine decodes complex polylines to provide precise, road-accurate delivery paths, factoring in real-world geography. |

## Data & Schema
MediFlow utilizes a hierarchical Firestore schema designed for high-concurrency performance:
*   **`/facilities`**: Metadata, type (urban/rural), and geospatial coordinates.
*   **`/inventory/{fac_id}/medicines`**: Sub-collection tracking individual batches and live stock levels.
*   **`/requests`**: Global collection for tracking movement, status (Pending/Approved/Fulfilled), and manifest details.
